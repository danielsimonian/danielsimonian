  <h1>Daniel Simonian's Profile</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my dev page</h2>
  <p>I am a versatile professional with a strong foundation in problem-solving, technical skills, and creative collaboration. My background in music production, teaching, and working with various software tools has honed my analytical skills and attention to detailâ€”key qualities I bring to programming. With extensive experience collaborating in diverse teams, I thrive in environments where creativity and teamwork are essential.

I am currently transitioning into the tech industry, where I am studying Web Development (Front and Back End) and Mobile Development at SENAC. I have earned a diploma and gained hands-on experience as a Junior Front-End Developer. Driven by a passion for continuous learning and adaptability, I thrive on taking on new challenges and am excited to apply my skills in a web development role.</p>
